# hmc5883l-embed
- because hmc5883l was taken -
### is a driver for embedded-hal for said magnetometer

the only tested method is get_angles() and it seems to work well

i only tested this with a bluepill

todo:
 - add an interrupt example
 - get rid of the panics
 - add tests ugh 
 - maybe support embedded-hal 1.*
