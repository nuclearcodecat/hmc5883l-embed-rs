# hmc5883l-embed
### hmc5883l-embed - because hmc5883l was taken - is a driver for rust's embedded-hal for said magnetometer

this library is more of a personal project, not sure if i'll ever upload it to crates. i'm sure there are many other, better libs. other than that i'm pretty sure it's not in a working state right now.

todo:
 - get rid of the panics
 - add tests ugh 
 - maybe support embedded-hal 1.*
